# CardMatchingAssemblyGame
Fancy game for your MS-DOS. ENJOY!

Okay, must notice that the code is far from clean

## TODOs:
- [ ] Rewrite some parts of the code to clarify what's going on
- [ ] Rewrite the whole game for it to satisfy protected mode
- [ ] Windows release?
- [ ] Why not Linux one too
